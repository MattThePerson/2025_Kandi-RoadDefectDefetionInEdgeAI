# NOTES

## IDEAS FOR BETTER DETECTION
- remove China drone images
- combine classes
- use only countries with good quality images (ie. Norway)



## Notes after 3th meeting
- unique folder for each run, parameter combination (or maybe job id)
- use gputest partition
- end of job, add: `seff $SLURM_JOBID`
