# Road Defect Detection in EdgeAi (2025)

By Matti, Elias and Jaakko

## About

Training YOLOv8m on the [RDD2022 dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/RDD2022_-_The_multi-national_Road_Damage_Dataset_released_through_CRDDC_2022/21431547) to detect road defects, and then quantizing it and optimizing it to run on a RaspberryPi + TPU.

## Dependencies

For local testing, set up virtual environment (eg. venv) and then install deps in the following order:

1. PyTorch. See instructions here (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
2. Install requirements.txt (run `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
